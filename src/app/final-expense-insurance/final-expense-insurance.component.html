                        Final expense insurance helps families cope with the loss of a loved one by guaranteeing all funeral and burial expenses will be paid for. With so many different options to choose from, the cost for a service, burial plot, casket, and headstone can range anywhere from $1000 to $10,000, and the grieving period is no time to be making complicated financial decisions.

                      <br>  Final expense insurance is a perfect alternative to traditional life insurance because it is more affordable, no medical exam is required, and premiums will not increase over time. In addition, final expense insurance can provide funds to your family within 24-48 hours of your passing whereas traditional life insurance plans can take weeks to pay out. This instant, short-term monetary relief can be crucial for staying current with mortgage payments and covering day-to-day living expenses.
                        
                       <br> No longer a luxury, final expense insurance is a necessity. So what are you waiting for? Give yourself and your loved one's peace of mind today.   </p>
